### Some Notes / Issues

I choose not to use typescript for time, but it would be the correct choice to use it. It would solve the need to check for the keys that have empty strings but being able to define the data and make these options attributes.

I looked into dataGrid and it would be a better choice for displaying the data. I opted to use cards just to show what my thought process was when I was walking through initially. If I was to do it again It would be better to use dataGrid
